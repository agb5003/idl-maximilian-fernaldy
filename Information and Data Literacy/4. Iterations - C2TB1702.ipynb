The `while` loop inside is responsible for deciding whether each `x` is a prime number or not.\n","\n","The `while` inner loop, starting from `d=2` and increasing `d` by 1, decides whether `x` is a divisor of `d`. The `if` statement (line 9) in the `while` loop decides if `x%d==0` holds, which means \"`x` is divisible by `d`\" or \"`d` is a divisor of `x`\".\n","The candidate for the divisor `d` can range from 2 to the square root of `x`, $\\sqrt{x}$. (Thus, the condition of the while loop is `d*d<=x`.)\n","This is based on the fact that\n","\n","* If `x` is a composite number (not a prime number), then there must be a divisor of `x` in the range from 2 to $\\sqrt{x}$.\n","* If x is prime, then there is no divisor of `x` in that range\n","\n","When `d` moves from 2 to $\\sqrt{x}$ in sequential order,\n","\n","* If `x%d==0` is True, then `x` is confirmed to be a composite number with divisor `d`, and the `break` statement in the 10th line terminates the `while` loop at this point. (**The `break` statement terminates the `while` inner loop, but not the `for` outer loop**.)\n","* If `x%d==0` is False, then `d` is not a divisor of `x`, so we increase `d` by one and return to the beginning of the `while` loop, as shown in lines 11 to 12.\n","\n","The `while` loop is exited in one of the following two cases.\n","\n","1. When a divisor `d` of `x` is found during the loop and the `break` statement in line 10 forces the loop to terminate. This happens when `x` is a composite number, in that case we leave the `while` loop even though `d*d<=x` is True.\n","2. When `d` exceeds $\\sqrt{x}$ and `d*d>x`. This happens when `x` is a prime number.\n","\n","Therefore, we can tell whether the `while` loop ended in 1. or 2. from the relationship between `d*d` and `x` at the end of the `while` loop.\n","\n","We use the `if` statement in line 14 to determine whether `d*d>x` is True or False, and if it is True, we increase `count` by 1 since x is prime (line 15).\n","This is the content of the `for` loop.\n","\n","After exiting the `for` loop, the final `print()` function (line 17) prints out the value of `count`, that is, the number of prime numbers found."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ubm1CsJww6C1"},"source":["# 4.4 Minor details\n","\n","Let us discuss about some details of the manipulation of lists using iterations (and conditional branching)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5eRhZG_tw8g0"},"source":["## 4.4.1 List comprehension\n","\n","We can use a method called **list comprehension** (already touched in Section 2.6.2) to define a list.
